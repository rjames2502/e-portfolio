<font size="+2"><pre><u><b>Unit 1: Scientific Investigations and Ethics</b></u></font>

**Unit objectives**
- Differrentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning.
- Understand why ethics are important and how they may relate to your area of research and your professional practice.

**Brief reflections from unit 1**

The module began with a review of Ethics in Computing.
- One thing to be clear from the outset, is that Ethics and Legality, are not always aligned,
  and this may lead to less than desirable situations (Resnik, 2020).
- Topics such as Data Protection Regulations, may help to protect somewhat the end users, however,
  with regulations differing somewhat between countries, and in some countries like the US, even
  within the different States themselves, there is no guarantee of this.
- People have a fundamental right to privacy, and this must be respected.
- Good research follows some guildelines and rtespects the law/s (ÖAWI, 2015).

<font size="+2"><u>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</u></font>


**Unit objectives**
- Examine the characteristics that make up a suitable research topic.
- Explore rational and creative methods	for formulating a research idea.
- Identify means of transforming research ideas into crafted research questions and proposal.
- Conduct a literature search, critique the literature and present a literature review.	

**Brief reflections from unit 2**
- There is a lot of material that follows the process past the Literature Review and onto the full planning methodology 
  for the Project which is definately invalauble for the understanding.
- Topic chosen should have ample literature (Harvard, ND) already available as base research. If wrong topic is chosen with insufficient
  secondary research available, to move to primary research could be difficult.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 3: Research Methods</b></u></font>

							
**Unit objectives**							
- Understand the different research methods.
- Know which data collection methods are related to each method of research.
- Have some idea which of these would be suited to your area of research.

**Brief reflections from unit 3**
- Multiple Research Methods possible: Exploratory Research, Conclusive Research, Qualitative Research,
  Quantitative research, Mixed Methods Research (Questionpro, ND).
- Each method is valid or not, and has its place, depending on the research requirement and depth of information needed (BRM, ND).
- Quantitative and Qualitative methodology is key here, to determining depth of research (Stevenson, 2023).

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</b></u></font>


**Unit objectives**
- Understand how to carry out each type of data collection methods.
- Discuss the advantage and drawback of the different methods.
- Consider the types of data you will obtain.
	
**Brief reflections from unit 4**
- Different data collection methods include Case Studies, Focus Groups, Quantitative observation, Qualitative observation.
- Advantages of focus groups is that discussion may be open-ended and lead to new avenues of research and flexibility in methods of data collection
  (UNSW, ND). Disadvantages include "following the crowd" and "groupthink" where participants do not share ideas in group setting (SIS, ND).
- Quantitative is data dealing with numbers - how much?, how many?, how often?. Qualitative is less specific. Can get a feeling for the data,
  but it is open to interpretation (Stevens, 2023).
  Benefits and drawbacks to both methodologies (GCU, 2023).

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 5: Interviews and Survey Methods</b></u></font>


**Unit objectives**
- Understand how interviews and surveys fit into research and whether either or both of these might be useful for your investigation.
- Understand how pre- and post-testing can be used in research.	
	
**Brief reflections from unit 5**
- Surveys obtain data directly from target audience, with potential to include large number of respondents (Jones et al, 2013).
- Multiple collection methods, including 1-2-1 interviews (by phone or in person), emailed questionnaire, paper copy etc,
  all with different benefits and drawbacks (Ponto, 2015).
- pre- and post-testing allows for verification after a new variable has been introduced, to see if there is a discernable change in response (Stratton, 2019).

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 6: Questionnaire Design</b></u></font>


**Unit objectives**
- Tell the difference between a good questionnaire and a poor one.
- Design a questionnaire to obtain the responses you will need for your investigation.
- Understand how the data obtained can be analysed.
	
**Brief reflections from unit 6**
- Importance of good survey/questionnaire design cannot be understated.
  Good data is critical at beginning of research phase. If bad data is analysed, it is difficult to achieve clear conclusions (Parab et al, 2010).
- Survey should be written without pre-guessing results to avoid manipulation and bias (Pannucci et al, 2010), (Charlesworth, 2022)..

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 7: Validity and Generalisability in Research</b></u></font>


**Unit objectives**
- Understand how the concepts of validity, generalisability and reliability affect your investigation and 
   the design of your research method.
- Consider how to analyse and present the results you obtain from your investigation and how they will
   enable you to answer your research question.

**Brief reflections from unit 7**	
- Presentation of results from investigation, need to be clear and concise.
- Validity is extent to which the data achieved what it set out to achieve
  Reliability is the consistency of the data collected - can it be trusted?
  Generalisability is the extent to which the findings can be applied in other settings (Shantikumar, 2018).
- Where possible, any findings or conclusions, under right conditions, may be repeatable.
- Questionnaire must be fit for purpose, and address through the questions, the topic that it is targetting.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 8: Inferential Statistics</b></u></font>


**Unit objectives**
- Identify the different levels of measurement.
- Produce measures of location and spread.
- Perform appropriate hypothesis tests.

**Brief reflections from unit 8**	
- Statistics can still be used to prove anything you want, however, they are a useful tool to analyse data (Bhandari, 2023).
- Importance of source data cannot be understated. If it comes from questionnaires, questions should be intelligently designed.
- Statistics are the best way to reject or accept hypotheses (Cuemath, ND), (Aransiola, 2021).
- Statistics allow us to visualise with numbers, the spread of results obtained through the data (Humansofdata, 2018).

  Can help to identify patterns in data, that could be hidden in just number analysis (studysmarter, ND).
- Provides a quick way to communicate information, in an easy to understand way (Techtarget, 2022).

- Planning is essential.
  Must be organised.
- Writing must be performed often - no possibility of completing a project "at the last minute".
- It should follow a well established presentation template (MIT, ND).
- Where possible, it should be on a subject that the author/s find interesting, as it will occupy a lot of their time.
