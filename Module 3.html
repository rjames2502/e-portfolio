							<u><b><pb>Security and Risk Management</pb></b></u>
<pre>This module will focus on the increasing requirement to pair Security and risk together in modern business. 
The module will cover a broad range of THREAT Models that are available, qualitative and quantitative assessments, 
as well as describing how to perform and carry out appropriate assessments.
As part of this module, it is required to work in small groups, in order to perform assessments of a business
and the risks associated with digitization and additionally becoming an online business.

The module is run over 12 weeks, split into 12 units.

Personal REFLECTIONS of the module will be recorded at the end of this page

<u><b><pb>Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management</pb></b></u>
							
<pre>"Risk management is the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level". 
The module begins by explaining why risk needs to be continually assessed, and how these assessments can help tailor the defences
appropriately to protect an Enterprise.

<pb>It can be split into 3 parts - 
1) Determine the different risks and vulnerabilities that may be presented, and the likelihood of them occurring.
2) Evaluate and prioritize the risk and establish mitigation processes/techniques against them.
3) Continual evaluation and assessment, so as things change, the mitigation can be adapted.<pb>

<pb>The unit continues to describe different methodologies for risk assessment, and shows where it can sometimes
go wrong during assessment. 
The favoured method uses quantitive analysis methods, as opposed to qualititive, as they are less subjective
and should be more accurate to define.<pb>

<pb>Industry 4.0 is introduced, as a method to digitize traditional manufacturing processe in order to make them more efficient.<pb>

<u><b><pb>Unit 2: Users, assessments and the Risk Management Process</pb></b></u>
<pre>
<pb>This unit covers the different types of assessment, focusing on benefits/drawbacks of using both of using Quantitive 
or Qualitative methods.
Detailed analysis of the Risk Management Process (RMP) is covered, with an interesting section that discusses the benefits of 
getting "buy-in" from all areas of the business, including normal users, and not just focusing on the more technical 
departments.<pb>

<b><pb>Assessment:</pb></b>
<pb>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 (cont'd)
The group discussion continued, and there was a post against my original submission. I responded to this (see below).
Work continued on the preparation for the Risk Identification report, that is due to be submitted in week 6.

<u><b><pb>Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</pb></b></u>
<pre>
<pb>This unit continued to cover the different types of assessment, focusing on benefits/drawbacks of using both of using Quantitive 
or Qualitative methods.
A large focus of the study this week, was directed towards the many popular threat modelling techniques.
The different techniques allow for them to be used for different assessments, and by people with different skillsets.
Some of the techniques are more accurate in their assessment than others.<pb>

The group discussion ended this week, and I posted a summary of the topic. (see below).

<b><pb>Assessment:</pb></b>
<pb>Risk Identification Report(cont'd)
We continued the group work this week, by both email and WhatsApp messaging.
A google share was setup, where we have saved the working report.
I started working on an Attack Tree, to visually aid us with the report itself.

<u><b><pb>Unit 5: An Introduction to Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise</pb></b></u>

<pre>
<pb>During this unit, we covered the different types of data standards that have to be adhered to. GDPR, ISO27000, PCIO-DSS and 
NIST were covered.There was a comprehensive coverage of how to incorporate adherence to these Data Standards into organisations
successfully. Having a defined standard in place, but not confirming to it, could be both financially and reputationally damaging
for a company.

<b><pb>Assessment:</pb></b>
<pb>Risk Identification Report(cont'd)
We continued the group work this week, and had a group discussion via Zoom. (see below).
As part of the report, I was tasked with writing the introduction to the report, and I also created an Attack Tree
that highlighted the risks associated with different parts of the business.
