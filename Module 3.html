							<h1>Module 3 - Security and Risk Management</h1>
						
							<pb>Security and Risk Management</pb>
<pre>This module will focus on the increasing requirement to pair Security and risk together in modern business. 
The module will cover a broad range of THREAT Models that are available, qualitative and quantitative assessments, 
as well as descibing how to perform and carry out appropriate assessments.
As part of this module, it is required to work in small groups, in order to perform assessments of a business
and the risks associated with digitization and additionally becoming an online business.

<pb>Unit 1:</pb>
"Risk management is the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level". 
The module begins by explaining why risk needs to be continually assessed, and how these assessments can help tailor the defences
appropriately to protect an Enterprise.

It can be split into 3 parts - 
1) Determine the different risks and vulnerabilities that may be presented, and the likelihood of them occurring.
2) Evaluate and prioritize the risk and establish mitigation processes/techniques against them.
3) Continual evaluation and assessment, so as things change, the mitigation can be adapted.

The unit continues to describe different methodologies for risk assessment, and shows where it casn sometimes
go wrong during assessment. 
The favoured method uses quantitive analysis methods, as opposed to qualititive, as they are less subjective
and should be more accurate to define.

Industry 4.0 is introduced, as a method to ditigize traditional manufacturing processes, to make them more efficient.

The following post is related to Industry 4.0

As part of the fimal assessment, we are tasked to work in groups, and perform an intial, followed by a detailed risk 
assessment on a theoretical local business, looking to expand internationally.
We will need to cover all aspects of risk, not just those related to the IT/Cyber Security side of the business.
