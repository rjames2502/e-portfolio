							<h1>Module 3 - Security and Risk Management</h1>
	
<font size="+2"><p><a href="https://online.essex.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SRM_PCOM7E_PG_COM-1.pdf" >**Link to University of Essex - Security and Risk Management Module Page**</a></p></font>

							
							<font size="+2"><p><u><b><pb>Security and Risk Management</pb></b></u></font>
<pre>This module will focus on the increasing requirement to pair Security and risk together in modern business. 
The module will cover a broad range of THREAT Models that are available, qualitative and quantitative assessments, 
as well as describing how to perform and carry out appropriate assessments.
As part of this module, it is required to work in small groups, in order to perform assessments of a business
and the risks associated with digitization and additionally becoming an online business.

The module is run over 12 weeks, split into 12 units.

Personal REFLECTIONS of the module will be recorded at the end of this page

<font size="+2"><pre><u><b>Unit 1: An Introduction to Security and Risk Management</b></u></font>
							
"Risk management is the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level". 
The module begins by explaining why risk needs to be continually assessed, and how these assessments can help tailor the defences
appropriately to protect an Enterprise.

It can be split into 3 parts - 
1) Determine the different risks and vulnerabilities that may be presented, and the likelihood of them occurring.
2) Evaluate and prioritize the risk and establish mitigation processes/techniques against them.
3) Continual evaluation and assessment, so as things change, the mitigation can be adapted.

The unit continues to describe different methodologies for risk assessment, and shows where it can sometimes
go wrong during assessment. 
The favoured method uses quantitive analysis methods, as opposed to qualititive, as they are less subjective
and should be more accurate to define.

Industry 4.0 is introduced, as a method to digitize traditional manufacturing processe in order to make them more efficient.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 2: Users, assessments and the Risk Management Process</b></u></font>


This unit covers the different types of assessment, focusing on benefits/drawbacks of using both of using Quantitive 
or Qualitative methods.
Detailed analysis of the Risk Management Process (RMP) is covered, with an interesting section that discusses the benefits of 
getting "buy-in" from all areas of the business, including normal users, and not just focusing on the more technical 
departments.

Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 (cont'd)
The group discussion continued, and there was a post against my original submission. I responded to this (see below).
Work continued on the preparation for the Risk Identification report, that is due to be submitted in week 6.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</b></u></font>


This unit continued to cover the different types of assessment, focusing on benefits/drawbacks of using both of using Quantitive 
or Qualitative methods.
A large focus of the study this week, was directed towards the many popular threat modelling techniques.
The different techniques allow for them to be used for different assessments, and by people with different skillsets.
Some of the techniques are more accurate in their assessment than others.

<font size="+2"><b>Assessment:</b></font>
Collaborative Learning Discussion 1 (cont'd)
The group discussion ended this week, and I posted a summary of the topic. (see below).
Work continued on the preparation for the Risk Identification report, that is due to be submitted in week 6.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 4: Application of Threat Modelling and Management Techniques</b></u></font>

Unit 4 continued with Threat assessments, but dialed down into the detail much more. Some of the reading literature focused on 
STRIDE methodology, but gave specific and detailed examples, of different threats that can be associated
with the different STRIDE categories.
Other text covered the identification of the different threats, but then went on to examine the casuality between the different
risk factors.
In https://eis.hu.edu.jo/deanshipfiles/pub112337045.pdf there was a particularly useful table that showed a particular 
event defined, and then associated to it, was identified causal events. In some cases, it went from one possible event to another,
through the linking of the different sub-threats throughout the table.	

<font size="+2"><b>Assessment:</b></font>
Risk Identification Report(cont'd)
We continued the group work this week, by both email and WhatsApp messaging.
A google share was setup, where we have saved the working report.
I worked on an Attack Tree, to visually aid us with the report itself.
Personally, I found the Attack Tree to be most useful, as it allowed me to mentally define and categorize, a lot of potential events
together under a single heading. The Attack Tree allowed me to try and think of the risks, from different sides of the business,
and not just purely from an IT perspective.
	

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 5: An Introduction to Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise</b></u></font>


During this unit, we covered the different types of data standards that have to be adhered to. GDPR, ISO27000, PCIO-DSS and 
NIST were covered.There was a comprehensive coverage of how to incorporate adherence to these Data Standards into organisations
successfully. Having a defined standard in place, but not confirming to it, could be both financially and reputationally damaging
for a company.
Different indistries have different requirements, and from a business perspective, it is important to know which apply, 
especially as in many instances, more than one standard is valid.
During the group seminar, I discussed a Case Study called "Right to be Forgotten" from https://dataprotection.ie/en/pre-gdpr/case-studies#201701
In this study, it described a case where a person was effectively destroyed online, through information pertaining to them partaking in criminal
activities, and losing their job due to poor performance and dishonesty.
This information was widely published, leading to the persons reputation being damaged extensively.
The truth however, was far different. 
The person had been found "not guilty" in a court of law, and had actually left their job voluntarily for personal reasons, and on good terms.
The discussion was primarily about the complete lack of control from the search engine, and a complete disregard for personal data privacy.
The search engine stated, that it was in the public interest to publish this story, but they had not performed due dilligence to verify that the 
information was correct and accurate.
Once the information is published, it is very difficult to ensure that all erronous data is removed from every site on the Internet.
Subsequent searches, will likely find reference to false information.
We discussed how it would be prudent to implement strong fines for false data release, however, these are probably quite difficult
to implement globally.

Risk Identification Report(cont'd)
We continued the group work this week, and had a group discussion via Zoom. (see below).
As part of the report, I was tasked with writing the introduction to the report, and I also refined and finished the Attack Tree,
that highlighted the risks associated with different parts of the business.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 6: The Practical Implications of Security and Risk Standards</b></u></font>


This week continued with the different frameworks/standards that should be applied to data protection.
Most people have heard of GDRP for data protection, but there are other standards such as Sarbanes-Oxley(SOX)
and HIPAA that must sometimes also be adhered to. Failure to comply with these standards can have huge 
implications for a business.
In this instance, frameworks are important, as they help to give structure and help with following the policies and 
processes.
Alongside GDPR, a number of other standards such as ISO27000, NISTCSF and COBIT were also discussed.
	

<font size="+2"><b>Assessment:</b></font>
The initial Risk Identification Report was finalised and handed in this week.
In addition, there was a requirement to formally review the performance of my peers.
I generally do not feel that this is an appropriate thing to do, however, it was approached fairly and honestly.
For the assessment, I was lucky that my group are working consistently and hard on the teamwork aspects, so a positivie review
was easy to write.
There was also a section for self review. In all honesty, who would ever write that they think they are performing badly??

For the assessment, my personal contribution was the attack tree shown in week 5, and the following introduction.
I also collaborated with my peers, on some of the risks and their associated assessed value.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 7: An Introduction to the Concepts of Quantitive Risk Modelling</b></u></font>


This week focused on 2 main quantitiative risk assessment models - Monte Carlo and Bayes Theorem.
Multiple Crisis Decision Analysis (MCDA) is also discussed, and like all methods, requires appropriate selection of data for
analysis.
TOPSIS, AHP and ANP are discussed, and give some feedback about which method is most appropriate to be used, depending
on the required output.
These methodologies are designed to be repeatable and not open to personal interpretation, meaning that it should be possible
to run the algorithms multiple times, by multiple unconnected people, yet still achieve the same results each time.
These methodoligies however, are very complex in comparison to other qualitative methods such as CVSS.

<font size="+2"><b>Assessment:</b></font>
Collaborative Learning Discussion 2 
The 2nd group discussion began this week, and I interacted with my tutor through both an online seminar
and via this discussion (see complete transcript attached below).
This interaction really made me think more deeply, about what constitutes a qualitative vx quantitative analysis, and the 
criteria that can be used when making the assessments.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 8: Implementing Quantitive Risk Models</b></u></font>


Week 8 continued with the quantitative risk methodologies - Bayes Theorem and Monte Carlo, and their practical approach and implementations.
The methodolgy is sound, but it is clear that to use them properly, it needs a lot of time and practice, 
in order to understand exactly what data is required and how it should be applied.
							

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 9: Risk, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</b></u></font>


Disaster recovery was introduced this week, as a way of mitigating some risk.
DR can cover different many scenarios starting from having good backups of data that can be restored, through to Enterprise level requirements.
At the top end of the scale, DR can consist of multiple Datacenters in the Cloud or geographically seperately located, with continuous replication between 
them, of all data and systems.
Risk analysis is relevant to DR, as it is important to understand what the impact to a business is, if their data is unavailable. The length 
of time that the business can run without this access, helps to dictate the level of DR preparedness that is implemented.
Naturally, cost vs risk needs to also be considered.
Concepts such as RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) were also introduced, as a way to determine the level of DR required.<pb>						

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 10: Practical Applications and Issues in DR Implementations</b></u></font>

Disaster recovery continued this week, and focused more on the Cloud options available.
Cloud is the buzzword at the moment, and is heralded as the answer to a lot of problems.
Whilst it has its benefits and advantages, there are definately some drawbacks that are associated 
with this model - security, cost, vendor lock-in and lack of control are most prominent.
Mitigation is possible to reduce the negative aspects, but there is always a balance that needs to
be weighed.

As part of the seminar preparation, we were asked to detail issues with both vendor lock-in when migrating to the cloud, as well as any security
concerns with the cloud itself.
The issues with vendor lock-in, are caused by different CSPs using proprietary software or formats. This makes it very difficult for any user/company
to migrate their data away in the future, either to premises or another CSP.
The best way to alleviate this, is to insist that the data is stored in Open or common standards. This way, any tie-in of the data itself will be 
removed.
Regarding security in the cloud, a lot of the problem is having to trust a CSP to secure the enviromnet properly.
Having agreed standards with the CSP before deployment in the cloud, and periodic checks and verifications can help to alleviate this risk as well.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 11: Futute Trends in Security and Risk Management</b></u></font>


We started to look at future trends in the Security and Risk Management area.
Changes in Enterprise Risk Management were explored, as well as looking at new methodologies for SRM assessments.
Also covered was Development Security Operations (DevSecOps), which is essentially calling for tighter cooperation 
between Programmers, System Administrators and Security experts, throughout the complete software delivery lifecycle.
This extended cooperation could help to ensure that security aspects are integrated completely into the developement process, and thus
ensuring more secure and stable releases of code.
Artifical Intelligence(AI)/Machine Learning(ML) was also introduced.
AI can help to automate defence from attacks, as well as aid in. keeping systems patched and upto date with the latest code or security revisions.

Developement Team Project:Executive Summary
Working with my peer group, we finalised the Executive Summary.
This summary built on the initial report in week 6, by providing a more detailed quantitative analysis of the risks present by moving
to an online business model. It also covered aspects of a DR plan, based on paremeters defined by the business owner.
My individual contribution to this summary, was to complete the DR section, and to provide a high-level schema to show a possible
DR setup in the cloud.

<font size="+2"><u><b>Unit 12:The Great Debate: What will be the most influential trend in SRM in the next 5 years?</b></u></font>

The final week continued with a focus on future trends. There was a seminar, where I presented a number of slides
based around AI and Machine Learning.<pb>

E-Portfolio + Persona Reflections
The remainder of the week was spent working on the e-portfolio, as it must be. submitted as part of the assessment.
In addition, we were tasked to perform a personal reflection, over the course of the module. This reflection must show 
what we have learnt, but more from the perspective of personal evolution, rather than just what the subject matter covered.
These reflections will be attached below as well.
