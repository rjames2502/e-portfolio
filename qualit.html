							<h1>Assessment - Security and Risk Management Collaboration Discussion 2 - All posts</h1>

              		<p>Initial post<p>								
<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) formula, is an open framework, designed to be used to assess and grade the severity of software vulnerabilities 
using different metric groups (nvd, nd). 
Its strength was meant to be that different and unconnected people, performing an assessment, would be able to assess and grade a vulnerability in the same way 
resulting in the same quantitative grading. Qualitative grading, such as low, medium and high, which are supposedly more open to interpretation, would 
therefore be avoided, leading to a more balanced assessment.
Spring et al (Spring et al, 2021) believe that there is a lack of justification for using the formula for grading and assessment, as the method used is not robust 
and therefore may not stand up to scrutiny. They go on to state that “different communities would plausibly find different metrics, more or less important” 
which is the antithesis of what CVSS is trying to achieve.
 Within Spring et al, the authors mention Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) (Secursive, 2020) as an alternative to CVSS. SSVC from the 
beginning is clearer, that the grading will be performed from the standpoints of different stakeholders, allowing for different categorizations to be 
associated with each vulnerability. The different grading will be brought together, and from there, a final classification will be associated with the 
vulnerability. This different methodology is expected to bring a clearer decision-making process to the fore, but it is possible that as different groups 
will still be assessing, the results would be wildly different in some cases.  (Spring et al 2, 2021) is written by a lot of the authors of the original paper, 
and has a section where they compare SSVC with some other existing methodologies. It is clear that the authors favour SSVC over others, though they do make 
reasonable points for its strengths. 
 My personal view is that though the CVSS formula does not appear to be perfect, as long as the reasoning behind grading is displayed, it is still far more useful and 
accurate than by using a qualitative method of classification. From the perspective of a particular group of people, the grading process, should be possible to be 
standardised, so that each member of the group is looking at the vulnerabilities from a similar perspective. The difficulty comes when trying to share the data 
amongst different groups of people, with very potentially a completely different outlook again, but this is then a very similar strategy to using SSVC methodology, 
so it may be best to use that method directly.

<p>Tutor response<p>								
<p>Hi Robert
but the question is: is CVSS a qualitative or quantitative assessment methodology? What do you think? Review the definitions and look at 
the basis of the CVSS equations - what do you think? Ignoring popularity for a second, do you think it could be done any more effectively
or accurately?<p>
