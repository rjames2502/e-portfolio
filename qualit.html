							<h1>Assessment - Security and Risk Management Collaboration Discussion 1 - Summary</h1>

              		<p>My Summary response<p>								
<p>In my initial post, I described how the digitization of legacy processes, into Industry 4.0, is changing the way that big industry performs 
and manufactures products. This movement, has many benefits such as reduced cost and optimization, but there are drawbacks, such as 
reduced requirement for human staffing, which could drastically alter the employment pool in the manufacturing area.
From reading through responses from my peers, it is clear that they see Industry 4.0 as an evolution which has both benefits and 
drawbacks to its evolution.
The advantages of Industry 4.0, include increased productivity, easier expansion and costs to name a few, all of which can help to 
enable growth and efficiency (machinemetrics, 2018), lightsondata (Lightsondata, ND). 

	Benefits for a business are clear, but the negatives are less well publicized. With a new modernized manufacturing process, the human 
impact would be significant. As I mentioned in my original post, there would be a significant requirement for retraining of existing 
staff, or employment of new, more technically aware people. The level of technical ability in staff will increase greatly over the 
majority of staff employed today, which in itself, could be quite difficult and costly to achieve. Inevitably, there will be a large 
number of people currently employed, that are no longer needed due to automation or lack of required skills.

With the new concept being “online all the time”, there is a perhaps not new, but significantly increased risk of Cyber-attack.
Though not really a business, Iran found out the hard way, what the risks of being connected really are (nordvpn, 2022). The Stuxnet virus 
caused chaos in their nuclear facilities, but was designed to be very specific in the damage that it caused, and only affected Windows 
machines with connections to Siemens PLCs (manufacturing machines).

	Progress and change are inevitable, but it is essential that as the industry moves to a new model, that the cyber security and processes 
implemented, are maintained and adjusted continuously.
Vigilance will become the “key word” for Cyber Security within the Industry 4.0 model.
