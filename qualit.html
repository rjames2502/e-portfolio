							<h1>Assessment - Security and Risk Management Collaboration Discussion 2 - All posts</h1>

              		<p>Initial post<p>								
<p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) formula, is an open framework, designed to be used to assess and grade the severity of software vulnerabilities 
using different metric groups (nvd, nd). 
Its strength was meant to be that different and unconnected people, performing an assessment, would be able to assess and grade a vulnerability in the same way 
resulting in the same quantitative grading. Qualitative grading, such as low, medium and high, which are supposedly more open to interpretation, would 
therefore be avoided, leading to a more balanced assessment.
Spring et al (Spring et al, 2021) believe that there is a lack of justification for using the formula for grading and assessment, as the method used is not robust 
and therefore may not stand up to scrutiny. They go on to state that “different communities would plausibly find different metrics, more or less important” 
which is the antithesis of what CVSS is trying to achieve.
 Within Spring et al, the authors mention Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC) (Secursive, 2020) as an alternative to CVSS. SSVC from the 
beginning is clearer, that the grading will be performed from the standpoints of different stakeholders, allowing for different categorizations to be 
associated with each vulnerability. The different grading will be brought together, and from there, a final classification will be associated with the 
vulnerability. This different methodology is expected to bring a clearer decision-making process to the fore, but it is possible that as different groups 
will still be assessing, the results would be wildly different in some cases.  (Spring et al 2, 2021) is written by a lot of the authors of the original paper, 
and has a section where they compare SSVC with some other existing methodologies. It is clear that the authors favour SSVC over others, though they do make 
reasonable points for its strengths. 
 My personal view is that though the CVSS formula does not appear to be perfect, as long as the reasoning behind grading is displayed, it is still far more useful and 
accurate than by using a qualitative method of classification. From the perspective of a particular group of people, the grading process, should be possible to be 
standardised, so that each member of the group is looking at the vulnerabilities from a similar perspective. The difficulty comes when trying to share the data 
amongst different groups of people, with very potentially a completely different outlook again, but this is then a very similar strategy to using SSVC methodology, 
so it may be best to use that method directly.

<p>Hi Robert
but the question is: is CVSS a qualitative or quantitative assessment methodology? What do you think? Review the definitions and look at 
the basis of the CVSS equations - what do you think? Ignoring popularity for a second, do you think it could be done any more effectively
or accurately?<p>
							
<p>Response to tutor<p>								
<p>Hi Doug,

I reread Spring et al, and various other sources online, and I think it is fair to conclude that the majority consider CVSS to be 
qualitative instead of quantitative. 
I feel that this is primarily down to the grading methodology used, and the quality of the source information used to make the assessment. 
It seems that for me at least, the easiest way to understand the methodology is that as soon as there is any element of personal opinion 
presented in the results, classification has to be regarded as qualitative, simply because the next person may have a different view. 
I think that if the quality of the source data can be standardised and documented, it may be possible to perform CVSS assessments in a 
quantitative manner. 
Hyunchol et al (Hyunchal, nd) seem to suggest that they think it is reasonable to think that it is possible to combine CVSS and quantitative 
assessment together, providing these standards are in place ahead of time and for everyone to use - setting the scene so to speak. 
They state that quantitative methods are quite routine in finance and banking (something that Jane alluded to in the last seminar) and through 
the use of the Markov Process (Markov, 2007) and better defined risk matrixes, assessments can be performed in a more repeatable manner. 
The Ngoc et al paper (Ngoc, 2018) provides an example using CVSS and Markov, to assess the threats to Cloud Security, so there is clearly a 
requirement for this in the industry.

<p>Tutor final response<p>								
<p>Hi Robert
this is an excellent and well-researched post. I think the key points in your post are:
"It seems that for me at least, the easiest way to understand the methodology is that as soon as there is any element of personal opinion presented in 
the results, classification has to be regarded as qualitative, simply because the next person may have a different view."
I think for CVSS this is the KEY differentiator between a qualitative and quantitative approach to any kind of risk assessment. 

"I think that if the quality of the source data can be standardised and documented, it may be possible to perform CVSS assessments in a quantitative 
manner."
I think this (and the following paragraphs) also make an excellent point - if you change the underlying methodology or the way that assumptions are
generated then it may change the overall basis of the measure - for example a paper by Doynikova and Kotenko (2017) looks at using probabilistic methods
to modify the operation of CVSS - does this make it more quantitative? I'll let you read the paper and make your own decision - but this is only one 
attempt to change the operation and basis of CVSS - so as you commented above this kind of approach may eventually lead to the 'quantification' of the CVSS 
approach.
