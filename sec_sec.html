							<h1>Assessment - Security and Risk Management Collaboration Discussion 1</h1>
							
							<p>Tutor response<p>
								
<p>You make some excellent points in your post. 
  Back in the seventies, when the first microcomputers emerged, there was talk about the upskilling of the labour force, 
  four-day weeks and better jobs and lives for everyone. I think most people would agree that never happened so your 
  points about retraining and upskilling are well made. How do you think we could actually achieve the intended utopia 
  this time? DO you think everyone would be happy to be retrained? Can you see any risks in redeploying people and roles?<p>

              		<p>My response<p>
								
<p>I think that the willingness to retrain and work with more technical processes, is variable within the population.
A recent Gartner survey (Computerworld, 2018) states that there are noticeable differences amongst the population based on age. 
They saw that the most willing participants for retraining or working in a different way, was amongst the 18–24-year old’s, 
followed by the older population above 54 years old.
Personally, I found this quite interesting, as I would have thought that the “middle ground” would have been more willing, 
  as they would like to keep relevant in the modern workforce.
I think that there will always be a requirement for the more manual/menial roles, regardless of technology, so there is a 
  risk of pushing the technical agenda to everyone, as it could leave gaps in the workforce.
We have seen in Austria, as well as other countries (SRHM, 2021), particularly in the areas related to the Tourism industry, 
  that a lot of people left and retrained due to the Covid pandemic. These areas were the first to lay off people, so many 
  retrained and went into other industries or roles. They are now very reluctant to go back to their old jobs, as many have 
  found jobs with better pay and conditions, and with more robustness against further layoffs.
It is possible that with this “upskilling”, personal utopia is achieved – better pay, more prospects, increased happiness 
  in a job etc, at the expense of other positions that people would have traditionally settled for.<p>
