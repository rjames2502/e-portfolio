 Abi has essentially been employed to analyse data, collate the information and present it in a report to the Manufacturer.
  
  From an ethical perspective, it would certainly be wrong, if he were to change data values, in order to make the report more acceptable to the customer, 
or to “fit their agenda” of promoting Whizzz as a healthy cereal. 
Abi is obligated as a researcher (inferred as independent) to present all relevant facts, regardless of if they are positive or negative, as essentially, 
that is what he has been asked to do.
If Abi were to only use some specific other data, that would change the results of his previous testing, this could be said to be bordering on a case of data 
falsification (Springer, ND). Springer state that falsification, is where research data is manipulated with the intention of giving a false impression, and 
would include the omitting of relevant data in order to change the findings. By performing the additional correlations to change the results, this would be an 
unethical presentation of only a half-truth.
 Naderer (Naderer, 2020) finds that “food advertising in various forms has an impact on children’s eating behaviour, and therefore can have a negative long-term 
impact on children’s development of overweight or obesity”, which gives weight to the belief that any report into the nutritional benefits of a food, should be 
as accurate as possible.
There are also legal ramifications, if the nutritional benefit of the food is misrepresented, and Food Business Operators (FBOs) have a legal obligation to 
fulfil different legislation, such as that in the EU or the US (Jurica et al, 2021). In the EU, Food Fraud is described in Reg. 178/2002/EC [1], and it can be 
argued that by only presenting half of the facts, Whizzz cereal would be in breach of at least 2 of the 4 main criteria – to show intent to commit deception of 
the customer, and a breach of regulations related to food and feed safety legislation. 
Abi cannot be held personally responsible, for how the Customer chooses to use the data in advertising, but he needs to be clear what his position is – he found 
Whizzz Cereal to be potentially harmful. This standpoint should be carefully documented, so that if there is ever any legal comeback, he would be able to defend 
his findings, legally if necessary, and to show that he shared his findings directly with the Manufacturer of Whizzz.
 Mark Twain famously said "facts are stubborn, but statistics are pliable", but whether this is the case or not, for something potentially harmful, it is not 
right to only include "good" data in order to manipulate the results.
