Hi Anna,

Thank you for the interesting response.
It is sad to see that this type of workplace behaviour still continues today.

From the description of the scenario, it appears that the work environment is very much “results driven”, where the end result is more important than the manner in which it was achieved.
I have seen this type of behaviour first-hand, when I worked in the financial markets in London in the late 90’s/early 2000’s, and some of the things that were allowed on the dealer floors were really quite incredible.
An Australian Study shows (li et al, 2023) that by addressing workplace bullying, at source through better people management practices, it results in there being a more harmonious workplace environment leading to better team unity and better personnel engagement, which will naturally benefit the company involved, but also is better for the employees as well.

The personal effects of bullying can be quite detrimental, leading to outcomes such as depression and other health problems. 
It has also been shown in a study performed in Korea (Park et al, 2016), that workplace bullying, through creating a feeling of job insecurity, can actually lead to a decrease in work engagement, thus exacerbating the effects that the bullying was meant to be addressing in the first place.

As you said, if we compare the conduct of the Interactive Technologies Team, it conflicts with a large number of BCS conduct codes (BCS, 2022).

It is the responsibility of organisations, regardless of their size or location, to ensure that any work environment, is free from bullying or abuse of any kind, and that any necessary disciplinary procedures are defined and fair.
