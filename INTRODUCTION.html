  INTRODUCTION<p>
<p>To identify the risks and benefits under different scenarios, a risk assessment of the company Pampered Pets was performed.
Pampered Pets is currently looking to digitize their operation, and change from a local-area focused business, into a more global company. These transformations could bring big benefits to the business, but also carry significant risks.
Two risk analyses were performed, firstly on the current local business model, and secondly, on the proposed model of a larger, internationally operating business. 
The method of Threat Modeling used for both assessments was the Quantitative Threat Modeling Method – QTMM (QTMM, 2022). QTMM allows us to combine different methodologies, to determine the perceived threat for each category, but also by using quantitative assessment, allows us to categorize the threats using more factual data (trustnetinc, ND).
Initially, an Attack Tree (Threat Tree for Online Business) was created (Isograph, ND), which allowed us to identify and classify some of the threats. The tree used Boolean OR logic, meaning, that any threat can be “standalone” OR credible, in conjunction with other threat/s. We subsequently used a combination of STRIDE (STRIDE, 2021) and CVSS (CVSS, 2022) modeling, to rate and rank the different threats based on the quantitative scoring.<p>
