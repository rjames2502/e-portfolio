Hi Sahib,

Your response makes some interesting points.

The usage of dark UX Patterns for manipulation, may be just an evolution of selling behaviour, that was previously seen in traditional brick-and-mortar stores personally.
Examples would be where the Cashier desks are positioned at the back of the store, so you need to walk past most of the store to pay for any items you want to purchase, or the layout of Ikea Home furnishing Stores in Europe, where they would like you to follow the arrows around the complete store, regardless of what you are looking to purchase, or even “3 for 2” on some items, to fool you into thinking that the shop is cheaper, but other goods are more expensive than the competitors to even out the “offers”.

A study (Alawadhi et al, 2016) confirms that store layout and a perception of it being busy or crowded, help to reinforce to the shopper that it must be worth the effort to shop there. This modelling shows that manipulation as part of the buying experience is nothing new.
 Perhaps people in general, are far more easily manipulated than we would like to think.

The recent increase in online shopping practices changes the game a bit though.
From an online shopping site perspective, and using an understanding of human psychology, a web page is designed to appeal more through whatever means – colours, shapes, Lay-out, etc, in order to try and convince the shopper to purchase more of the items.

The same practices used in real shops, are copied online, but with much more simplicity.
Gray states (Gray et al, 2021) “We also rely upon recent work that describes the role of crafty psychological nudging through the incorporation of “dark patterns” and instances where coercion is blatantly described in ways that often force users to make decisions against their own best interest—what Gray and colleagues describe as “asshole designs””. 
What is also interesting in their study, is that their results show that a very high percentage of users (over 80%) mistrust smartphone applications or websites, at least some of the time, and not just related to shopping experiences.
This “non-default-trust” perception is not surprising, as I am sure we have all seen websites with offers for things that just seem to be too good to be true.

I think your conclusion is very interesting, as the usage of dark UX can certainly be called dishonest or unethical, and it certainly breaks a number of the BCS principles along the way.
I think that it could be difficult however, to easily change the laws to prevent this, though the EU-GDPR is going some way to try and address this for member states, and have published “guidelines” to web designers as well as users, to be able to recognise and avoid using Dark UX patterns (EDPB, 2022).
