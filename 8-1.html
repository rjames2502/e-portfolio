							<h1>Assessment - Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct Collaboration Discussion 1</h1>
							
							<p>Initial Post<p>

I have chosen the Malware Case Study to review.

The company, aptly named “Rogue Services” functions as a web hosting platform, with guarantees of 100% uptime, irregardless of any external factors.

Many of Rogue Services clients are small businesses, that would certainly appreciate the guarantee of availability, however, there are many negative aspects to their business model, which would be detrimental to their business functionality and their reputation. 
Rogue’s methodology appears to be that they will provide the web-hosting service, but without any regard to security or vulnerabilities that could in turn have negative impact on end users.
By providing a service in this manner, it could be said to contravene multiple codes of conduct from BCS – the Chartered Institute of IT (BCS, 2022), including, amongst others,  Public Interest rule 1(a) – have due regard for security and wellbeing of others, rule 1(b) – have due regards for the legitimate rights of third Parties, Professional Competence and Integrity rule 2(c) – maintain standards relevant to your field.
The main code that appears to be particularly relevant however, is rule 2(f) – avoid injuring others, their property, reputation, or employment by false  or malicious or negligent action or inaction, with the keyword here being “inaction”. 

When a company provides a web-hosting service, it has a responsibility to provide that service in as secure a manner as possible. Indeed, there are many resources freely available, that provide lists of services, that a good web-hosting company should provide as part of their offering (DevOps, 2022), (CloudPanel, 2023). By not addressing any of the vulnerabilities such as ransomware, spam, malware etc, they are moving the responsibility to the end-user, of which it is not guaranteed that they will be sufficiently protected. 
As we can see from the IEEE document (IEEE, 2022), endpoint security is not something that should be underestimated. Large corporations have defined strategies to counter the risk, but what of the average web-user, sitting at home, do they have the same protection?

The service offered by Rogue Services, is really not fit for purpose as a modern web-hosting service. To make it viable, it would need to incorporate all of the required protection factors against known and unknown (where possible) vulnerabilities, even if this means more work and effort from Rogue Services to achieve this.
