<p>Personal Reflection on module Security and Risk Management<p>
<p>This essay is a reflection of the 12-week Security and Risk Management module.<p>

<p>	I am currently employed as a Network Architect, with a focus leaning towards WAN technologies, so I am used to considering technical 
risk when developing and implementing different solutions. 
When I develop and evaluate a solution though, my assessment of risk is quite narrow – essentially it is from my perspective as a WAN Architect, 
asking if the solution ticks all of “my” necessary boxes, and perhaps those of the other technical teams.<p>

<p>	One of the main things that I would say I have more respect and understanding for now, is that the risk assessment sometimes needs to be 
broader – more lateral thinking, and encompass all of the different viewpoints that should be considered, not just technical. By working in a “silo”, 
other parts of the business, may be neglected or somewhat ignored. Of course, sometimes specificity is key when performing an assessment, but the 
main point learnt is to be aware of the big picture and adapt accordingly.<p>

<p>	I found that using graphical Attack Trees, helped enormously, as it shows all risks pertaining to the different parts of the business, 
at the same time and on the same page. By doing this, it allows us formulate a good overview of the situation, and prioritise what is necessary. 
The data entered into an attack tree, can then be taken, put into tables and expanded in detail. 
It is only after all of the risks are known and appreciated, that a robust plan for mitigation can be developed. Again, I feel that this expanded 
approach is something I appreciate more, and will consider routinely in my work life. <p>

<p>	Early on in the module, Industry 4.0 was introduced as a continuous innovation of manufacturing processes and Internet of Things (IoT) 
in the modern age. There is an increased requirement for devices that were previously standalone, to connect to a Corporate Network or the Internet. 
This is particularly relevant for me at the moment, as I work for a large, international car company, and our main business is the manufacture and 
sale of vehicles. <p>

<p>	The threats to this perimeter are constant and evolving, and according to Leonhardt et al (Leonhardt et al, 2015) are “unknown or unknowable” 
making securing the environment difficult. From a security perspective, this really highlighted to me that any risk management processes that are 
implemented, should not be static, and need to be continually evaluated, updated, or changed as appropriate, to meet any new risks that have arisen 
or are likely to occur.<p>

<p>	Without fluidity in the risk assessment process, it would be inevitable over time, that more risks would remain undetected for longer.<p>

<p>	Naturally, a large part of this module covered the different approaches to risk assessments, especially with a focus on Qualitative vs 
Quantitative assessments.  
I would say that initially, I thought had a good understanding of how to perform a decent assessment, and that I understood clearly, what would 
make an assessment qualitative or quantitative. It was only through a collaborative learning response from my tutor, and another discussion during 
a seminar with the same tutor and my peers, that I really found it necessary to re-evaluate what I knew, and dig deeper into the topic.<p>

<p>	One particular point is that during the seminar, when we were talking about the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), we were asked 
if we thought it was quantitative or qualitative. Most of my peers responded with qualitative, but at the time, I thought it was leaning more towards 
quantitative due to the enhanced methodology used for the assessment. This discussion in particular, made me question what I knew, and I spent 
additional time trying to understand the real differences between the assessment types.
During this time, I found a paper (Hyunchol et al, nd) that described methodology for performing a CVSS quantitative assessment. This was the 
“light-bulb” paper for me, as it made me really appreciate that it is the quality of the data used that is key to the assessment.<p>

<p>	If there is any possibility of personal interpretation, even via unconscious bias, it is not possible for the assessment to be quantitative, 
as it would not be repeatable if performed by someone else independently. This does not in itself, make qualitative assessments bad, but may perhaps 
be considered as “locally significant or relevant” to the person or organization that performed the assessment. 
From the module texts, and through the seminars, it is very clear that different people think different things are important, and this could lead to 
inconclusive results.<p>

<p>	For any assessment that needs to be repeatable, the data used and methodology behind it, must be clearly defined, agreed, and documented 
in advance.<p>

<p>	During this module, there was an element of team collaboration required for the project work.
I helped to establish the way we worked early on, and then I hosted the almost weekly meetings. There was a definite improvement to our team work 
after we had established a structure. As a team, I think overall, it was a positive experience, and the team worked well together throughout. 
All were engaged and interested.<p>
	
<p>	My overall reflection when I look back at this module is positive, and there are a number of points that I feel I will be able to use regularly 
in my role.
I have definitely learnt a lot more about risk assessments, and what I knew before, has been reinforced and enhanced. 
I think my key take-home from this module, is that we should not take everything at face value as we read through the texts. To question 
respectfully is a good thing, as it leads to more critical thinking. I knew from my previous studies, but it was enforced here, that additional 
side reading on the different topics, at worst will help to enforce what we already know, and at best, it could help to enhance our knowledge further, 
leading to a deeper understanding overall.
