							<p>Initial Post</p>
							<p>Two Security technologies that can be used are the use of authentication and implementation of IPS/IDS devices.

Multi-factor (MFA) or dual factor authentication (2FA), are tools that can be used to help secure access to different online resources. A common way of implementing this technology is that after an initial login with username and password, the user is presented with a follow-up method of authentication. This can be in the form of a series of additional questions, that would typically have been setup previously and tailored by the user, or, another method would be where a separate one-time code, is sent to the user’s mobile phone, which then needs to be entered into the login portal. Again, this would have had to have been setup previously in order to be able to complete the authentication.
The benefit of additional authentication is that it provides security beyond that of a normal username/password combination (Corsicatech, 2021). 
However, there are some weaknesses. In addition to potential financial costs that can be exploited as well. Typically, through social engineering, it is possible to find out personal details, that can assist with answering any of the questions, as human nature dictates that the questions chosen for authentication, will be most relevant to that person as they are easiest to remember. Changing mobile phone number also presents a problem, as does SIM Swapping/cloning (Itproportal, 2019). However, 2FA or MFA are certainly a better option than a single login process to prevent unauthorized logins.  

The implementation of Intrusion Detection, and/or Intrusion Prevention devices (IDS/IPS), either as a separate physical device, or in software, can help to secure Corporate Networks from outside malicious attacks or flows.
IDS is a passive device that monitors the Network traffic, and will alert you that your Network is under some sort of attack. IPS is an active device, and whilst it generally performs the same function as an IDS device, it also has the capability of blocking or limiting the suspect traffic that is passing through it (Okta, ND). Both technologies examine the traffic that traverses through the device, and examines it, looking for known attacks and unusual traffic patterns. Additionally, IPS may have the ability to respond dynamically and alter the allowed flows based on “normal” traffic patterns over a period of time – known as Machine learning. IDS and IPS are normally used together, in conjunction with other technologies such as Firewalls (Techtarget, 2015).
This additional protection comes at a cost. Firstly, an Enterprise needs to have skilled staff available to configure and manage the devices, and there is also a significant cost associates to these devices.
There is also a risk that corporate traffic that should be allowed under normal conditions, is misidentified, and marked as a “false positive”. This misidentification, could prevent legitimate network flows from passing through the device, or in the case of IDS only, alerting that there is a potential issue. These alerts can both impact the functionality of the Network, but also, require the knowledgeable staff to react and deal with them (Rapid7, 2020). 
Depending on WAN bandwidth and physical capacity of the IPS device, there could also be a performance degradation, due to either the amount of traffic traversing the device, processing ability of the device, or a combination of both factors.</p>

							<p>Summary Post</p>
				</p>In my initial post, I covered the use of Authentication, and the use of IDS/IPS.
These technologies are in widespread use; however, they are not alone, and are only part of what should be a robust cyber security model to defend against various attacks. Reading through the responses from my peers, it is clear that Network Firewalls feature prominently, as do more targeted defense mechanisms such as Web Application Firewalls (WAF), through to more client focused, endpoint protection such as anti-virus, data encryption and more.	
A good defense strategy should begin with identifying what needs to be protected, before selecting ways to do that efficiently. Legacy Firewalls for example, are almost certainly deployed in most organizations, and whilst they can be considered essential, their effectiveness against some forms of attacks of vulnerabilities is insufficient. A concept of layered Cyber Security defense is a good place to start.
Layered defense modelling, can begin with looking at the OSI model (sagepub, 2019), (ipwithease, ND), and understanding what attacks are possible, and what needs to be employed in order to mitigate them. The sagepub article, is looking at security from an Internet of Things (IoT) standpoint, but it is equally valid in other areas of networking, and shows the vast number of possible vulnerabilities that exist.
Once the area of concern is identified, the right defense can then be implemented (totalprosource, 2021). This is unlikely to be a single device or technology, but again, another layered approach, that may protect the Network in general, for example, Firewalls, including Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs), IDS/IPS, through to endpoint and data protection using Web Application Firewalls, encryption, anti-virus, VPNs etc. 
As the reliance on IT increases constantly, it is apparent that the cyber security standpoint has to evolve in line with the potential attacks. 
The same can also be said of the people that are employed to defend against them.	In my initial post, I covered the use of Authentication, and the use of IDS/IPS.
