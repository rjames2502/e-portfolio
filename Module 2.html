<pre>This module covers the impact of Cyber Security from the perspective of Design and Implementation. 
There will be a project that focuses heavily on Network Vulnerability Assessments.
Throughout this module, I will be making notes on the content that has been covered and recording my observations here.

<pb>Unit 1:</pb>
Unit 1 was an overview of the challenges of implementing a secure Cyber Security defense.
It was clear from the reading material, that we would be working towards learning and understanding, how to perform a vulnerability assessment of a website as part of our module assessment strategy.
We covered in depth, the security breach implemented by Russian aggressors using Solarwinds Network Management Software. 
The fact that this breach was really only discovered by accident, is shocking, but it leads us to believe, that there could be many more breaches in other Software, that is lying dormant or undetected until now. 
The reputation of Solarwinds suffered greatly, but they may not be unique.
We covered the concept of the Cyber Kill Chain, as a methodology for understanding how Cyber Attacks may be implemented.


<pb>Unit 2:</pb>
Unit 2 began with the concept of Threat Modelling as a strategy, to strengthen the Security perimeter, and mitigate the risk of attack. Concepts such as STRIDE and DREAD were introduced, which define a type of Security risk, and then, if discovered, allocate a “cost” to it based on its severity. As part of my reading, I discovered that Microsoft, who effectively created the DREAD classification model, have actually started moving away from this, and have simplified their classification strategy.
This unit also covered the basic requirements of any good IT Infrastructure that are required for a good Cyber defense.
Network Penetration Testing was also introduced, starting with the concepts, and then moving on to the possible methodologies and tools that can be utilized.
We had been allocated a particular website for test purposes, and started to examine its security with Penetration Testing Tools.
The move for businesses to digitized platforms was covered, and included the risk vs benefit of the migration, as well as the ongoing support required.


<pb>Unit 3:</pb>
Unit 3 increased the focus on Penetration Testing, and the methodology that can be used to assess it.
Initial scans of the website allocated to us were performed, both to establish an initial assessment of the current Security implementation, and to get practice using some of the available tools.
At the end of this unit, there was an assessment to perform a baseline analysis of the website allocated to us, and put it into a report that would show a complete plan for a full assessment.
Web tools were used predominantly here.


<pb>Unit 4:</pb>
Unit 4 continued with the focus on Penetration testing as a tool for Network assessment, but it introduced an Open-Source tool called Kali Linux. Kali is a mostly free Penetration toolkit, based on a Linux image. It can be installed directly onto a partition, or, as I did it, run through some virtualization software called VirtualBox, and install the .ISO from there.
Kali tools are much more useful and powerful than those typically available for free on the Public Internet, and it allowed me to perform some tests that I was unable to before, and with more information returned.
The use of logging on devices as a means for attackers to gain access to systems was also discussed.
