							<p>Initial Post
								
Cyber Security is as vital today for personal use, as it is for Business, and for many people, performing “ordinary” tasks online is a regular occurrence. 
For example, due to a change in business models from many banks (Ioannis et al, 2018), it is increasingly likely that personal banking functions are performed online. This adds a level of convenience, but it is open to exploitation. Common scams such as spoofing of links in emails, as well as more advanced methods that fraudulently recreate web pages are common. Education for online use such as that provided by the Metropolitan Police (Metropolitan Police N.D) is vital to try and minimise the risk. 
The risk to businesses and Governments from cyber-attacks is huge and is getting worse. Checkpoint (Checkpoint N.D) have categorised current attacks as “Generation 5” to reflect the evolution and seriousness of the threat.
Businesses are at risk of having their reputation damaged intensely, such as in the banking example above, and losing public trust in their services, as well as potential loss or theft of intellectual property or sabotage, so the risk should be managed and mitigated.
Cyber warfare (Daedalus, 2020) is also now prominent in people’s minds, due to recent events, and it carries a real threat of escalation. The risk of spying and the stealing of state secrets such as weapons or personnel data, are also now embedded deeply into the cyber realm.
It is vital that the value of experts in the Security field are acknowledged, in order to help safeguard their Operations in the long-term. Maintaining good Cyber Security practices, not only helps to keep the business’s reputation and its own intellectual property safe, but it helps to ensure that there is no negative outcome due to a situation that could have been avoided.

							<p>Summary Post
								
It was interesting to read, not just the responses to my post, but the posts, and reactions to the posts of my peers.
A common theme in a lot of these posts is that the cyber threat is endemic globally, and that it shows no sign of dissipating.
According to the European Parliament (Europarl, 2022), cybersecurity threats towards Enterprise businesses in many different sectors, are actually increasing, and this was clearly exacerbated by the recent Covid pandemic, with Ransomware currently leading the charge but not alone. It is reported that up to 76% of Europeans feel at risk of increasing threat of cybercrime.
As the European Societies (Buil-Gil et al, 2020) article shows, recent cybercrime events, are not however just restricted to large Enterprises, but can affect many people online. From Table 1, within the same article, it shows a huge increase in personal hacking and online fraud year on year, likely due to the shift in personal online behaviour during lockdowns, which reinforces the belief that cybercrime has the potential to affect everyone.
As I briefly mentioned in my Induction assignment, the digital transformation during Covid, has altered the IT landscape beyond anything that was perhaps imaginable before but with a “cyber” cost.
The first 3 units of this module helped reinforce the fact that technical solutions and moderation of user behaviour online, need to go hand in hand to best protect the resources and people. The best technical solution with poor user behaviour such as password indiscipline, may not provide the robust security levels that are desired and vice-versa. To provide and implement these requirements, ongoing education for users is very important, but it is vital this approach is backed up by strong and robust cybersecurity protocols, in order to minimize any threat.
