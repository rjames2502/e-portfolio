							<p>Initial Post<p>
								
<p>Industry 4.0 as defined by Kovaite et al (Kovaite, 2019) is a “catch-all” label for the digitalisation and 
  transformation of manufacturing processes. Consisting of technical drivers such as robotics, 
  Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud Computing, amongst others, it is transforming legacy processes from a slow 
  and potentially laborious method, into processes that are more automated, streamlined and fit for the Internet age. 
  The migration to this model, however, is not without associated risks. If we look at a traditional production line 
  in a factory, the type of people working there, are likely to have a very different skillset to those that would be 
  required in a “state of the art” automated factory, where the former manual labour, is now being performed by Robots. 
  This would necessitate the requirement for substantial retraining, or additional hiring of skilled staff that would 
  be able to function in this type of environment. Another risk associated with Industry 4.0, is the potential requirement, 
  that a lot of the infrastructure would need to be contactable, hence requiring continued access to the public Internet. 
  This creates a risk of cyber attacks and/or Denial of Service type attacks, that would previously have not been possible 
  to achieve, with the more legacy and manual processes being performed. According to CyberSec Europe (Cybersec, 2022), 
  The Manufacturing sector is currently the most popular target for cyber-attacks. The article at i-Scoop (i-Scoop, ND) 
  supports the evolution of the Manufacturing world, towards the concept of Industry 4.0. The article clearly highlights however, 
  that any migration should be implemented as part of a long-term, defined and well thought out plan.<p>
